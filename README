PSID.pm version 1.60
====================

This class is designed to handle PlaySID files (usually bearing a .sid
extension), which are music player and data routines converted from the
Commodore-64 computer with an additional informational header prepended. For
further details about the exact file format, the description of all PSID
fields and for about SID tunes in general, see the excellent SIDPLAY homepage
at: http://www.geocities.com/SiliconValley/Lakes/5147/ (You can find
literally thousands of SID tunes in the High Voltage SID Collection at:
http://www.hvsc.c64.org)

This class can handle both version 1 and version 2 PSID files. The class was
designed primarily to make it easier to look at and change the PSID header
fields, so many of the methods are geared towards that.
